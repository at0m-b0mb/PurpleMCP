"""The Attack/Defend arena catalog — the red-vs-blue pairings.

Each :class:`ArenaCase` maps an attack to its vulnerable server, the hardened
twin, the tool to call, and the payloads. :func:`judge` then reads a tool result
and decides whether the guardrail held — the heuristic is deliberately explicit
(refusal phrases + an attack-success "proof" string) so the verdict is honest and
