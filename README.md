PurpleMCP teaches the full lifecycle of the **Model Context Protocol** — the open standard that lets
AI models call real tools. It does three things, and the third is what makes it *purple* (red team +
blue team together):

| Pillar | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| 🏗️ **Build & Connect** | A multi-provider host that connects **local models (Ollama)** *and* **cloud models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, OpenRouter)** to MCP servers — plus clean example servers and a one-command installer. |
| 🔴 **Attack** *(lab only)* | Intentionally-vulnerable MCP servers + working exploits for **23** MCP threat classes, so you can *see* how the protocol gets abused. |
| 🔵 **Defend** | A reusable hardening library, hardened twins of every vulnerable server, a static **security scanner**, and a **Defense Lab that runs the defense for real** — explanation on one side, live protection on the other. |

> [!WARNING]
> The [`attacks/`](attacks/) folder contains **intentionally vulnerable code** for security education.
> It only runs on `localhost`, refuses to start without an explicit opt-in flag, and "exfiltrates" only
> to a fake local sink. **Read [ETHICS.md](ETHICS.md) before using it. Only test systems you own.**

> [!TIP]
> **New to MCP security? Start here →** **[The MCP Security Handbook](docs/MCP-SECURITY-GUIDE.md)** —
> a complete, in-depth guide to the protocol, the 23 attack classes, and the 18 guardrails that stop
> them. (Also readable in-app via the **Learn** page.)

## ✨ See it in action

The whole teaching method is *show, don't tell* — you watch the attack land, then watch the defense
stop it, with the real technical output streaming live. Every lab also has a **manual terminal**: the
exact commands behind each demo, ready to **copy into your own shell** *or* **run in place**.

## 🧠 What is MCP, in one paragraph?

The **Model Context Protocol** is an open standard (think "USB-C for AI tools"). An **MCP server**
exposes *tools*, *resources*, and *prompts*. An **MCP host** (the thing running the model) connects to
those servers and lets the model call the tools. So instead of an LLM that can only talk, you get one
that can read files, hit APIs, query databases — whatever the servers expose. That power is exactly why
the security story matters: every tool is a new way in.

## 🏛️ Architecture

```
        LOCAL                  CLOUD
     ┌─────────┐   ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
     │ Ollama  │   │ Claude · GPT · Gemini · OpenRouter │   ← bring your own key
     └────┬────┘   └─────────────────┬─────────────────┘
          │                          │
          └───────────┬──────────────┘
                      ▼
        ┌──────────────────────────────┐
        │     PurpleMCP Host            │   purplemcp/
        │  providers/  →  one interface │   • normalizes tool-calling across LLMs
        │  host/agent  →  the loop      │   • discovers tools, runs the call loop
        └───────────────┬──────────────┘
                        │  MCP (stdio / streamable-http)
        ┌───────────────┼───────────────────────────────┐
        ▼               ▼                                ▼
  ┌───────────┐   ┌───────────┐                   ┌─────────────┐
  │  servers/ │   │ attacks/ ⚠│                   │  defense/   │
  │  (clean)  │   │(vulnerable)│  ───── fix ────▶ │ (hardened)  │
  └───────────┘   └───────────┘                   └─────────────┘
```

The same host can point at a **clean** server, a **vulnerable** one, or its **hardened** twin — that
side-by-side is the whole teaching method.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, and [Ollama](https://ollama.com) if you want local models
(you already have it if `ollama --version` works).

```bash
# 1. Install PurpleMCP (editable, so edits take effect immediately)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[gui]"      # include the desktop GUI; use `pip install -e .` for CLI-only

# 2. Configure keys (only the providers you want; Ollama needs none)
cp .env.example .env         # then edit .env

# 3. Pull a TOOL-CAPABLE local model (skip if you only use cloud)
ollama pull qwen2.5          # the default; reliably does structured tool calls

# 4. Launch the desktop app — drive everything from here
purplemcp gui
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Use a model that actually calls tools.** Every feature here (the agent, the Chat Playground, the
> benchmark's model probe) needs *structured* tool-calling. `qwen2.5` is the default and does this
> reliably. `llama3.1` chats fine but often just **narrates a JSON blob describing a call instead of
> making one** — so the tools never run and the Chat Playground looks broken. If chat "does nothing,"
> that's almost always the model: switch to `qwen2.5`. (See [docs/03-installing-models.md](docs/03-installing-models.md).)

Prefer the terminal? The same core powers a full CLI:

```bash
purplemcp providers                       # which LLMs are configured/ready
purplemcp servers                         # which MCP servers are registered
purplemcp tools --server calculator       # list a server's tools
purplemcp ask "what is 19% of 4,200 plus the square root of 144?" -s calculator
purplemcp chat -s calculator -s notes     # interactive, multi-server chat
```

Want Claude/GPT instead of local? Put the key in `.env` and add `--provider anthropic` (or `openai`,
`gemini`, `openrouter`).

---

## 🖥️ Desktop GUI

`purplemcp gui` opens a native, dark **purple-team security console** (PySide6) over the exact same core
the CLI uses — no separate server, no browser. It organizes all of PurpleMCP into clear sections:

| Section | Page | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overview | **Dashboard** | Provider readiness, registered servers, and lab stats at a glance. |
| Overview | **Learn** | The full handbook — README + every doc — rendered in-app, no context-switch. |
| Connect | **AI Models** | Install/run local Ollama models (list, **pull with live progress**, test, delete) and set/test cloud API keys (saved to `.env`). |
| Connect | **MCP Servers** | View the registry, **add your own servers**, one-click add from a **catalog of real published servers**, and install into Claude Desktop. |
| Connect | **Tool Explorer** | Browse a server's tools, inspect each JSON schema, and call any tool through an auto-generated form — no model required. |
| Connect | **Chat Playground** | Chat with any provider/model and watch the agent's **tool calls + results stream live** as inline cards. |
| Red team | **Attack Lab** | Browse all 23 attacks, **run the real exploit** with live output, and copy/run the commands from a built-in **manual terminal** (lab-gated). |
| Blue team | **Defense Lab** | **Explanation on the left, the defense running on the right**: the guardrail mechanism + source, a **Verify** that replays the payload (exploited → blocked), and a live **manual terminal**. |
| Blue team | **Security Scanner** | Run the static + dynamic scanner with a severity chart, summary pills, and per-finding cards. |
| Research | **Research** | Threat taxonomy (OWASP/CWE/ATLAS) + one-click benchmark with the defense matrix and JSON/MD export. |

> [!NOTE]
> **The manual terminal** lives in both labs. Each exploit/defense lists the *exact* `purplemcp …` /
> `python …` commands behind it — every one **copyable** (paste into your own shell) **and runnable in
> place**, with real subprocess output streaming into a colourised console. It's deliberately scoped to
> the project's own commands, so it stays a teaching tool, not an arbitrary shell.

Throughout, a **⌘K command palette** jumps to any page or action, **⌘1–9** switch pages, and a status
bar shows lab state, live async activity, and the default model.

## 🏗️ Pillar 1 — Build & Connect

The core idea: **one host, any model, any server.** Each provider is a small adapter implementing the
same interface, so the tool-calling loop in [`purplemcp/host/agent.py`](purplemcp/host/agent.py) doesn't
care whether it's driving a local Llama or cloud Claude.

```bash
purplemcp providers                      # readiness of each LLM
purplemcp tools --server filesystem      # introspect a server
purplemcp call  --server calculator --tool add --args '{"a":2,"b":3}'   # call a tool directly, no LLM
purplemcp ask   "summarize my notes" --provider openai --server notes
purplemcp install claude-desktop --server calculator   # add to Claude Desktop config
```

See [docs/03-installing-models.md](docs/03-installing-models.md).

## 🔴 Pillar 2 — Attack *(lab only)*

Twenty-three self-contained modules, each a **vulnerable server + an exploit + a writeup**:

| # | Attack | What the attacker achieves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | **Tool poisoning** | Hidden instructions in a tool *description* hijack the model |
| 02 | **Indirect prompt injection** | Malicious text in *returned data* steers the model |
| 03 | **Command injection** | A tool that shells out runs attacker commands |
| 04 | **Path traversal** | A file tool reads `/etc/passwd` outside its root |
| 05 | **SSRF** | A fetch tool is tricked into hitting `169.254.169.254` / internal hosts |
| 06 | **Token theft / confused deputy** | A tool leaks the credentials it was trusted with |
| 07 | **Rug pull** | A tool changes its behavior *after* you approved it |
| 08 | **Excessive permissions** | Over-broad scopes turn a small bug into a big breach |
| 09 | **Data exfiltration** | Sensitive data is smuggled out through tool arguments |
| 10 | **SQL injection** | A search tool builds SQL from input and dumps hidden rows |
| 11 | **Template / format-string injection** | `str.format` on a caller's template reaches secrets/globals |
| 12 | **Tool shadowing** | A 2nd server registers the same tool name and intercepts calls |
| 13 | **Insecure deserialization** | A tool `pickle.loads` an attacker blob → code execution |
| 14 | **Broken access control (IDOR)** | A tool returns any record by id, ignoring the caller |
| 15 | **Unrestricted file write** | A save tool escapes its root and overwrites startup files |
| 16 | **Weak randomness** | "Secure" tokens minted from time/PRNG are forgeable |
| 17 | **Output / log injection** | Tool output forges log lines / control chars into context |
| 18 | **Eval / expression injection** | A "calculator" tool uses `eval()` — arbitrary code execution |
| 19 | **Zip slip** | An archive member named `../x` writes outside the extract dir |
| 20 | **Mass assignment** | An update tool binds any field the caller sends — including `role` |
| 21 | **CSV / formula injection** | An exported cell starting with `=` runs as a spreadsheet formula |
| 22 | **Unbounded output / context flooding** | One tool call returns megabytes, flooding the model's context (DoS + cost) |
| 23 | **Argument / flag injection** | A caller's value becomes a command-line *option*, not data (no shell needed) |

Full catalog with mechanics: [docs/04-attack-catalog.md](docs/04-attack-catalog.md). Each lives in
[`attacks/NN_*/`](attacks/) and is gated by the safety switch.

## 🔵 Pillar 3 — Defend

Every attack above has a **hardened twin** in [`defense/`](defense/) that imports the reusable primitives
in [`purplemcp/guardrails/`](purplemcp/guardrails/):

| Threat | Guardrail |
| --- | --- |
| Path traversal | `guardrails.paths.safe_resolve()` — canonicalize + confine to root |
| SSRF | `guardrails.net.safe_get()` — block private/link-local IPs, scheme allowlist |
| Command injection | `guardrails.exec.run()` — no shell, arg allowlist |
| Tool poisoning / rug pull | `guardrails.descriptions` — sanitize + pin tool definitions |
| Credential leak | `guardrails.secrets.scrub()` — strip secrets from outputs |
| Over-trust | `guardrails.approval` — human-in-the-loop for dangerous tools |
| Abuse / runaway | `guardrails.ratelimit` — per-tool rate limiting |
| SQL injection | `guardrails.sqlsafe` — parameterized queries + identifier/LIKE escaping |
| Template / SSTI | `guardrails.templating.safe_format()` — `$name` only, no attribute access |
| Tool shadowing | `guardrails.registry` — detect name collisions, allowlist `(server, tool)` |
| Insecure deserialization | `guardrails.serialization.safe_loads()` — JSON only, refuses pickle |
| Broken access control | `guardrails.authz.assert_owner()` — bind every access to the caller |
| Unrestricted file write | `guardrails.paths.safe_resolve()` — confine writes to a root |
| Weak randomness | `guardrails.tokens.new_token()` — CSPRNG + constant-time compare |
| Output / log injection | `guardrails.framing.sanitize_output()` — strip control chars, frame data |
| Eval / expression injection | `guardrails.safe_eval()` — ast-validated arithmetic, no names/calls |
| Zip slip | `guardrails.paths.safe_resolve()` — confine every archive member |
| Mass assignment | `guardrails.authz.assert_assignable()` — editable-field allowlist |
| CSV / formula injection | `guardrails.csvsafe.escape_formula()` — force formula cells to text |
| Unbounded output / flooding | `guardrails.limits.cap_text()` — hard byte ceiling on every tool result |
| Argument / flag injection | `guardrails.argv.safe_argv()` — pass values whole + a `--` end-of-options guard |

Prove it yourself, side by side — exploited on the left, blocked on the right:

```bash
export PURPLEMCP_LAB_ENABLED="i-understand-this-is-a-lab"
python defense/compare.py                # every case, red vs blue
python defense/compare.py ping           # just one (matches the tool/title)
```

And a scanner that flags risky MCP servers before you ever run them:

```bash
purplemcp scan attacks/03_command_injection/vulnerable_server.py   # static analysis
purplemcp scan --server calculator                                 # live tool inspection
```

## 🔬 Research

PurpleMCP is built to be a reproducible research artifact, not just a demo:

- **Threat taxonomy** — every module is mapped to **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Apps (2025)**, **CWE**, and
  **MITRE ATLAS** in [`purplemcp/taxonomy.py`](purplemcp/taxonomy.py). Browse the full table in
  [docs/TAXONOMY.md](docs/TAXONOMY.md) or run `purplemcp taxonomy`.
- **PurpleMCP-Bench** — `purplemcp bench` measures **guardrail effectiveness** (deterministic: attack vs
  vulnerable vs hardened twin) and, optionally, **model susceptibility** (`--provider`), writing JSON +
  Markdown to `results/`. A committed reference run is in
  [`results/guardrail-benchmark.md`](results/guardrail-benchmark.md) (17/17 cases fixed by the hardened
  twins).
- **SARIF output** — `purplemcp scan <path> --format sarif` emits SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub code scanning /
  any SAST UI.
- **Posture report** — `purplemcp report` stitches the taxonomy, a static scan of the lab's own code, and
  the guardrail inventory into one Markdown artifact ([docs/SECURITY-REPORT.md](docs/SECURITY-REPORT.md)).
- **CI** — [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs the test suite + benchmark on
  3.11/3.12 and uploads the scan as SARIF on every push.
- **Citable** — see [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff) and the full write-up in
  [docs/07-research-methodology.md](docs/07-research-methodology.md).

```bash
purplemcp bench                              # deterministic guardrail benchmark
purplemcp bench --provider ollama -m qwen2.5 # + model-susceptibility probe
purplemcp scan attacks --format sarif -o purplemcp.sarif
```

## 🧭 Suggested learning path

1. **[docs/01-what-is-mcp.md](docs/01-what-is-mcp.md)** — the protocol, concretely.
2. **Build** — run the clean servers; `purplemcp tools` / `ask` / `chat`.
3. **Attack** — pick one module, read its writeup, run the exploit, watch it work.
4. **Defend** — open the Defense Lab, read the guardrail, hit **Verify**, watch the same payload *fail*.
5. **Scan** — point `purplemcp scan` at both and compare findings.
6. **Build your own** — copy a clean server, then scan + harden it yourself.
